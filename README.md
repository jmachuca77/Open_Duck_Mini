We are making a miniature version of the BDX Droid by Disney. It is about 42 centimeters tall with its legs extended.
The full BOM cost should be under $400 !

This repo is kind of a hub where we centralize all resources related to this project. This is a working repo, so there are a lot of undocumented scripts :) We'll try to clean things up at some point.

# Updates

> Update 02/04/2024: You can try two policies we trained : [this one](BEST_WALK_ONNX.onnx) and [this one](BEST_WALK_ONNX_2.onnx)
> Run with the following arguments :
> python v2_rl_walk_mujoco.py --onnx_model_path ~/BEST_WALK_ONNX_2.onnx

> Update 15/03/2025: join our discord server to get help or show us your duck :) https://discord.gg/UtJZsgfQGe

> Update 07/02/2025: Big progress on sim2real, see videos above :)

> Update 24/02/2025: Working hard on sim2real ! 

> Update 07/02/2025 : We are writing documentation on the go, but the design and BOM should not change drastically. Still missing the "expression" features, but they can be added after building the robot!

> Update 22/01/2025 : The mechanical design is pretty much finalized (fixing some mistakes here and there). The current version does not include all the "expression" features we want to include in the final robot (LEDs for the eyes, a camera, a speaker and a microphone). We are now working on making it walk with reinforcement learning !

See [this document](docs/prepare_robot.md) for getting from a onshape design to a simulated robot in MuJoCo (Warning, outdated. Has not been updated in a while)

# RL stuff

We are switching to Mujoco Playground, see this [repo](https://github.com/apirrone/Open_Duck_Playground)
